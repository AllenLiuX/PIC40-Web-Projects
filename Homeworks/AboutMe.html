            <h2>Why I'm taking PIC 40A</h2>
            <p>
                I found it is pretty fun to design and implement an interactive website.
                <br>Lots of functionalities can be realized through a website, and it can provide various services to lots of people.
                <br>Taking PIC 40A will give me a systematic understanding and skill sets for the front-end. That's why I want to take PIC 40A.
