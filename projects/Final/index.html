<!--REMIND:-->
<!--Please view this website with Safari to see the poll result and use Chrome to see the parallax scrolling. Chrome doesn't load the divs as expected, probably due to the large load of this page.-->
<!--What I did for this project:-->
<!--First, my main effort is to create a beautiful poll website relying on CSS design and Javascript interaction.-->
<!--I made the 3D Parallax Scrolling such that the background image is scolling down with a slower speed compared with other elements on the webpage.-->
<!--It is realized by using the preserve-3d for transform-style and set overflow-allowed in CSS.-->
<!--Also, the layouts and colors are well-designed. I made a few CSS animations such that hovering on the title would make the title become bigger, and hovering on the background image would 'lighten' the image with a different opacity.-->

<!--Second, I used Javascript to ask for an input of viewer's favorite color, and correspondingly change the poll result showing in the figure and text.-->
<!--I used DOM to manipulate the style and innerHTML of the corresponding color, and did a few type coercion between Number and String.-->

<!--Third, this page was initially aimed to use PHP to store the input result into a txt and use JQuery AJAX to read the poll result in the txt.-->
<!--HOWEVER, I have tried for over an hour to fix the JQuery, but the pic server just cannot load JQuery script by any means (maybe because the page has too many things to load) while my code of JQuery can be used locally and on my own server.-->
<!--So, I failed to implement this important feature, but can only temporarily use a fixed original poll result written in HTML. I realized that this page may not be complicated enough, but please consider the situation that the JQuery doesn't work on my PIC server... Thank you!-->
